		<h1>Welcome to One Gif As A Service</h1>
		<p>Ogaas is a One gif as a service . Excessive consumption of gif by people has seen to cause GIFOPHOBIA or something else in these  lines. Moreover the option of lots of gifs for one tag has also lead to GIFOPHOBIA because you are scared you might not accept a good one. So we do it for you. We select any random and you have to just deal with it you sucker. To get protected from it we have started OGAAS. It's going to serve only and only one gif for a search result. While developing this I had to consume lots of GIFs which resulted in GIFOPHOBIA but I am suffering pain so you don't have to cheers.   </p>
